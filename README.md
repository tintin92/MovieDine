# Project-1
Movie-Dine - An All-In-One Streaming and Dining Experience

The goal of this project was to use to use the knowledge base we had gained through the first four weeks of class to create an interactive web experience with a clean user interface to enable users to search for both the streaming movies or tv shows they wish to watch and to search for dining options in their area from the convenience of one shared site.

We divided this project up into four parts: James and Tanner worked together to create the HTML and CSS frameworks for our site, while Nicolas and Ben created the Javascript files for the movie search and the food search respectively. The search for streaming movies and television shows utilized an API called "OTTDetails", while the food search utilized an API called "Restaurant Menus".
